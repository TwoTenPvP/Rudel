Rudel is a _WIP_ connection based, packet based networking protocol built ontop of UDP. It features reliability and sequencing.


The project is WIP. Once completed it will be moved into the MidLevel organization.


## Why?
Why another C# RUDP Library? We already have Lidgren, LiteNetLib, ENET with wrappers and many more?

Rudel was created to be a managed, high performance, simplistic library without bloat. Essentially a library with similar goals as ENET while being fully managed.
